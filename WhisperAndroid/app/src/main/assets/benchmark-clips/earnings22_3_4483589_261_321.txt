In addition, we increased our net retention rates in the fourth quarter significantly to 105% after a notable dip in the first half of 2021, with that retention rate of around mid 90s. This leaves TeamViewer with an average net retention rate of 98% over the past 12 months, underlying our success in billing lasting customer relationships. Uh, at the same time our subscriber churn rate further improved to 14% compared to 15.1% in 2020. This confirms our ability to retain the strong intake of customers, which we won from the COVID-19 pull forward demand in the previous year. At year end, we counted 627,000 subscribers, which is an increase of 7% compared to 2020 or roughly 43,000 more subscribers. Furthermore, our financial profile remains very strong with again lower leverage rate.
