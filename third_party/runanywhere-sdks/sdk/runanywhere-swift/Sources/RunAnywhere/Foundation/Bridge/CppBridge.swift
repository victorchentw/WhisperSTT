/**
 * CppBridge.swift
 *
 * Unified bridge architecture for C++ ↔ Swift interop.
 *
 * All C++ bridges are organized under a single namespace for:
 * - Consistent initialization/shutdown lifecycle
 * - Shared access to platform resources
 * - Clear ownership and dependency management
 *
 * ## Initialization Order
 *
 * ```swift
 * // Phase 1: Core init (sync) - must be called first
 * CppBridge.initialize(environment: .production)
 *   ├─ PlatformAdapter.register()  ← File ops, logging, keychain
 *   ├─ Events.register()           ← Analytics event callback
 *   ├─ Telemetry.initialize()      ← Telemetry HTTP callback
 *   └─ Device.register()           ← Device registration callbacks
 *
 * // Phase 2: Services init (async) - after HTTP is configured
 * await CppBridge.initializeServices()
 *   ├─ ModelAssignment.register()  ← Model assignment callbacks
 *   └─ Platform.register()         ← LLM/TTS service callbacks
 * ```
 *
 * ## Bridge Extensions (in Extensions/ folder)
 *
 * - CppBridge+PlatformAdapter.swift - File ops, logging, keychain, clock
 * - CppBridge+Environment.swift - Environment, DevConfig, Endpoints
 * - CppBridge+Telemetry.swift - Events, Telemetry
 * - CppBridge+Device.swift - Device registration
 * - CppBridge+State.swift - SDK state management
 * - CppBridge+HTTP.swift - HTTP transport
 * - CppBridge+Auth.swift - Authentication flow
 * - CppBridge+Services.swift - Service registry
 * - CppBridge+ModelPaths.swift - Model path utilities
 * - CppBridge+ModelRegistry.swift - Model registry
 * - CppBridge+ModelAssignment.swift - Model assignment
 * - CppBridge+Download.swift - Download manager
 * - CppBridge+Platform.swift - Platform services (Foundation Models, System TTS)
 * - CppBridge+LLM/STT/TTS/VAD.swift - AI component bridges
 * - CppBridge+VoiceAgent.swift - Voice agent bridge
 * - CppBridge+Storage/Strategy.swift - Storage utilities
